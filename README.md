# Week's Top 100 Songs Web Scraper

This project allows users to enter a date and retrieve the top 100 songs for that week from a specified website.

## How It Works

1. **Input Date**: Users input a date through the website interface.
2. **Web Scraping**: The backend Python code scrapes the website for the top 100 songs for the given week.
3. **Data Extraction**: The scraper extracts the song titles and other relevant information.
4. **Display**: The user is then presented with a list of the top 100 songs for the specified week on a new webpage.
